INTRODUCTION OF IDEAS/PAPERS AND RELATED WORKS****1) BlockChain:**BlockChain likes a ledger to record the transactions. However, there is no trusted third party to record it. Everyone should maintain the ledger. Every Transaction maintains the previous transaction's hash, the previous owner's private key and the receiver's public key. In this case, every transaction is no-denied. In order to solve the double spending question, Blockchain packages the previous transactions into a block. So everyone could check whether this coin(transaction) was used before. It is a typical P2P network.**2) Public, Private, Consortium, and Permissioned Blockchain：**	**public chain**: Public blockchain is universally accessible, that means anyone at any time can access the system, read data, send confirmable transactions and compete in recordkeeping. This kind of blockchain is generally referred to as a fully decentralized one, since no single individual or entity could control or tamper the data. Public blockchain uses tokens as an incentive, which encourages participants to compete in recordkeeping, and thus ensures the security of data. Bitcoin and Ethereum are two typical examples.	**Private Blockchain**: Private Blockchain requires strict limitation on participating nodes, with its write permission controlled by a certain organization. Since the participating nodes are limited and controllable, private blockchain ensures higher efficiency, better privacy, lower cost and is less vulnerable to malicious attacks. Besides, It can also meet other requirements in the financial industry, such as identification. Compared with centralized databases, private blockchain can prevent deliberate hiding or tampering of data by a single node inside the organization, and track the source if any error occurs. Thus , the private blockchain is more preferred by many major financial institutes.	**Consortium Blockchain**: Consortium Blockchain is managed by multiple organizations, each of which runs one or more nodes. Only these organizations in the system can read and write the data, as well as sending transactions and recording the data together.	**Permissioned Blockchain:** Permissioned Blockchain means that every node participating in the blockchain system has the permission, those nodes without permission are not allowed to access the system. So, Private and Consortium Blockchain also belong to Permissioned Blockchain. Some Permissioned Blockchains don’t have a token mechanism, because they don't use tokens to encourage recordkeeping competition.**3) smart contract:**	Smart contract was firstly proposed in Ethereum. It is written as 'solitary'. A solitary smart contract can only be used for one transaction type: If something happens, then something else happens.**4) Serverless computing：**	Serverless computing is a kind of cloud computing model. The client only needs to run the code on the cloud server, but not need to understand the configuration of infrastructure. The cloud computing provider would increase or decrease computing resources based on clients' tasks.**6) on-chain and off-chain:**	**On-chain** means the transaction should be broadcasted to all the nodes and recorded distributedly. Some nodes should verify it and make the consensus around all the nodes. If we use a smart contract, the same thing would happen, the node should verify the smart contract. To sum up, if every transaction is on-chain, the load for the block-chain network is very high.	**Off-chain** model is trying to solve this problem. From my understanding, it try to move the intensive computation task from on-chain to off-chain. After completing the computation, move it on-chain.**7) Sawtooth**	Hyperledger Sawtooth is an enterprise blockchain platform for building distributed ledger applications and networks.**8) monolithic architecture**	Monolithic architecture is considered to be a traditional way of building applications. A monolithic application is built as a single and indivisible unit.**9) microservices architecture**	While a monolithic application is a single unified unit, a microservices architecture breaks it down into a collection of smaller independent units. These units carry out every application process as a separate service.**2 Paper review:****(1) Off-Chain****The problem the paper try to solve:**Off-chain based block chain applications have become very popular. However, the traditional way is to offload the computation task on a monolithic architecture based server.However, for this method, there are three main questions:(1) Overheads of managing infrastructure such as initial configuration and resource provisioning(2) cost ineffectiveness caused by relatively low resource utilization(3) difficulty in scaling the monoliths in response to concurrent requests.Therefore, the author proposes a new architecture to support off-chain model----using microservices architecture.We hope to benefit from cloud computing technologies' fast development. The client can easily deploy auto scaling programs on the cloud. The cloud provider can automatically configure the infrastructure to satisfy the client's request. The paper changes the traditional off-chain model which used monotonic servers to a serverless model(cloud computing model).**Approach:****![img](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OEQehf7j-dwSsO4NU-PFp1f5iSxG5A9zQskt7oLjMmP43oLLjgJXpoP5kS3Xl3bdR2EcHYjrdyDE2Jbub2dw2i13JMji2t7tagM8Ox49Y3rM6NWH7-7c2q5iJq45rCQwyq8SrBuQ)**Reference [1] above:From the figure one, we can seeClients send requests to a validator who is responsible to execute batches of transactions, and handles persistence of blocks and states, networking, and consensus. Then a validator sends the request to TP Proxy through Tx Listener. Tx Listener would decide whether the computation in the task is on-chain or off-chain. If the computation is intensive, then TP Proxy would send it into Serverless microservices and wait for the computing result. After TP Proxy gets the result returned by serverless microservices, it returns to the validator, and validator makes it on-chain.**Result:**For the serial request, the performance between monolithic server and the serverless machine are almost the same. However, because of serverless server's autoscaling, the serverless performance is much higher than the monolithic one.**(2) CoopEdge****key words:** Edge computing, blockchain, cooperative edge computing, peer offloading, distributed consensus**The problem the paper try to solve:**Due to the fact that the cloud server is far from us, the latency is not acceptable in some computing tasks. In order to solve the problem, edge computing model appear. The core thought of this model is offload the computing task on the servers which near us. In order to implement it, we may need different providers' servers around us. However, no one like to provide their computing resource freely. So, we should pay for their computing resource. But how to choose a server? Can it autonomous?**Approach:**The paper tries to use the block chain to solve the problem above. It uses a block chain to record the transaction. After the executor completed the task, the network would value the quality of the task, then rank the executor and update the reputation of this executor. In this case, the task publisher would know who is the best worker through the workers' previous performance. The paper proposes a suite of complete p2p protocal to implement this， including the method to compute reputation and consensus algorithm.**Result:**The paper compared throughput, task dispatch time, consensus time and CPU utilization. The performance of both block-chain algorithm and consensus algorithm are better than traditional algorithms. **II. FORMAL PROPOSAL** **1)Introduction – Motivate your problem. Why is it important?**We will be working on a reproduction and extension of the off-chain serverless computation paper. Current blockchain and decentralized systems are bottlenecked by their need for consensus. Each transaction needs to be voted on in order to be committed. This is because each node needs to upkeep state transitions and perform consensus operations. Each node may not have high computational resource availability. Therefore, in this model conditional logic that is computation heavy, is not optimal. However, recent suggestions (including this paper) point to the possibility that event based permissions may allow secure nodes to perform computationally heavy tasks. This provides scale with each trusted centralized node that can perform these operations. **2) Problem Statement – What is the problem you are trying to solve?**Our paper will seek to solve low throughout and performance bottlenecks of distributed systems. It will seek to demonstrate the benefits at scale. It will attempt to show that as the problem size increases, the benefit continues to improve. In an effort to do so, we will use event based triggers to signal permissions for off chain or server-less computation.We will try to solve the problems caused by monolithic computing models. This will be done through a serverless computing model. The computing resources can be automatically configured, which would be beneficial for overhead, cost and flexibility. This is exactly the term elasticity from a systems standpoint. This off chain approach would be a cloud service used to employ stateless microservices. We want to first reproduce a similar result as the paper and then extend into our research. **3) Related Work**Included in this paper and other papers, some have tried to approach this problem with varying results. Different approaches have varying overhead costs. Some may have simple initial setup but do not scale. While other approaches may require more setup processes but scale very well. Additionally approaches may vary on their security constraints for deciding on trusted nodes or how to balance on chain and off chain balance. Further exploration into the related works will be done as we continue to develop our system. **4) Research Plan** Use Sawtooth to build a simple block-chain application. We would also use aws, docker, kubernetes to provide serverless technique. From there, we want to see the performance scale. We want to see how this works with multiple trusted off-chain machines. Additionally, we would want to see how throughput is affected when there is a hybrid balance of off-chain and on-chain transactions. This could mean changing trigger events or changing the amount of computation done in each approach**5) Proposed timeline** 2.7 ~ 2.20			understand smart contract and related works/approaches2.21 ~ 3.6			try to use sawtooth make a small block-chain app3.7 ~ 3.20			try to implement the system of p13.21 ~ 4.10			 try to use docker run the off-chain computing.4.10 ~ 		 		TBD  REFERENCES[1] Byungsoo Oh and Daeyoung Kim.
